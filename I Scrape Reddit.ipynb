      "1. Please don't post here if you aren't yet 30 - we will be removing posts from people under 30. r/SkincareAddiction has a fantastic list of the other subs on Reddit where you will be talking to your peers: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/related_subs\n",
      "\n",
      "2. We can't (and don't) offer medical advice. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your health. Your post will be removed for asking about medical conditions (for example: a photo and \"What is this?)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. No spam, self-promotion, direct product links or consumer surveys! If you would like to recommend a product, you may link it within a text post. Also, do not self-promote your app, blog, you tube reviews, cosmetic services etc. Please don't use this group for surveys or consumer research.  If you are doing academic research and would like to ask for permission to post about your study, YOU MUST contact the moderation team before doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Discussion of cosmetic surgeries / enhancements / treatments is totally cool here. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Selfies are not allowed EXCEPT on Selfie Sundays.  If you are posting to ask questions about a particular area of your face, you must edit your photo so it is clear what you are concerned about, either by cropping the photo or by blocking out features you are NOT asking about.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Be nice. Constructive criticism is cool, but acting like an ass is not. And do NOT post things like \"How old do you think I look / am\" as that never goes well. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. If you are shilling for a MLM company, you will be banned. Please see r/antiMLM if you want to know why.\n",

DO NOT RUB YOUR EYES\\n\\n-wash your face (or affected area) with cleansing SOAP and rinse with cool water for 3-5 minutes. Pepper spray is oil based, so water alone won’t help long term (although it might provide instant relief) you need oil removing soap.

So don’t wear makeup to protest, as well as oil-based sunscreen. EDIT: if it’s sunny and you don’t have non oil-based sunscreen still use any sunscreen because tear gas/pepper spray on top of sunburn is worse.\\n\\n-ABSOLUTELY no contact lenses, take them out with clean fingers before the protest. The powder can get stuck between the contact lens and the eye \\n\\nAfter exposure:\\n\\n-spray your face/ affected area with baking soda and water mixture. Three teaspoons for every 8.5 oz of water.  (There is a lack of scientific ev, but people claim it works)  EDIT: careful with this around the eyes, make sure the baking soda is completely dissolved before use\\n\\n-take off shoes/clothes before entering your home so that you do not spread the powder. Keep clothes outside for 2-5 days, wash them without anything else in the washing machine, twice.\\n\\n-20 minute cold shower, this prevents the tear gas from further irritating your skin. \\n\\n#BLACKLIVESMATTER', 'score': 10865, 'num_comments': 333, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gvbdyy/psa_skin_care_for_protesters/', 'post_id': 'gvbdyy'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Humor] I feel personally attacked', 'self_text': '', 'score': 10802, 'num_comments': 78, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/5shw16ktz6b31.jpg', 'post_id': 'cf3b7x'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[humor] Actual picture of me heading to bed after putting on my 4 different moisturizers and using my marula, rosehip, and squalane oils.', 'self_text': '', 'score': 10613, 'num_comments': 161, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/dluokvjlha041.jpg', 'post_id': 'e05xs4'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Puberty is making [Acne] hit hard but we’re trying to get through it with positive vibes :) Can’t wait to visit a dermatologist', 'self_text': '', 'score': 10505, 'num_comments': 435, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/o74bastn0iq41.jpg', 'post_id': 'fty5r5'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Before&After] Severely scarred Accutane poster skin update and new routine.', 'self_text': '', 'score': 10478, 'num_comments': 361, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/tmlwpa5kdqr01.jpg', 'post_id': '8c22rt'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Humor] it be like that', 'self_text': '', 'score': 10447, 'num_comments': 108, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/cgfoe90sfiq31.jpg', 'post_id': 'dd63s2'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Humor] SPF > all other skincare', 'self_text': '', 'score': 10386, 'num_comments': 416, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/lrccxnwvnm851.jpg', 'post_id': 'hkhf44'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'My mom opened her care package tonight.

I've been researching this too and because I can't develop any interest without getting obsessively curious about it for a while, I ended up learning, uh, a lot. There's really no magical products, but good formulations of certain ingredients that work.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all:\\n\\nConsistency is key. **Cleanse, treat, protect.**\\n\\nEvery day.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ Before anything, **SUNSCREEN**. While those light and invisible AB ones are more elegant, if you really want to fight that UVA destruction, use a high PPD one to protect your skin the most. If you don't care about that, consistency is key but remember to use a stronger sports one for longer sun exposure. This is basically your shield of Avalon, your lifelong investment that will pay off in the end. No matter what else you use and how much you spend on skincare, if you don't use sunscreen, it will be useless. Go out in daylight and enjoy your life, but protect your face, neck and chest at least.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Use the one of your choice, preferably with stable and good filters, starting with SPF50 and at least PPD16 or PA++++.) ^(|| I’d recommend to use one with high PPD because I care more about longterm UVA protection than cosmetic elegance, just make sure you have one you like, especially if you have a perma-tan or face darker than your body. But.) **^(THE BEST SUNSCREEN IS THE ONE YOU’LL USE.)**\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Tretinoin:** If sunscreen is your shield, this is your Excalibur and heavy hitter. It will refine texture, prevent lines, *reverse* damage, even out, brighten and perfect your skin as realistically possible. It's harsh, irritating and strong at first, but it works and it shows. You have to stay on life for this though to continue to gather benefits, but those anti aging products are minions compared to this Titan and its results. It makes the skin photosensitive, so you can't skip sunscreen at all or it will do more damage than good (!!!). Use only at night. Keep yourself hydrated and moisturized properly or it will damage your moisture barrier.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Start with alternate usage and slowly increase until your skin gets used to it. 0.025% is more than enough for anti-aging.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Vitamin C:** The best antioxidant you can use, especifically in the form of L-AA (Ascorbic Acid). Brightens discoloration, fades scars, evens out skin tone and pigmentation, encourages collagen growth and helps repair, prevent and reverse UV damage. Once a day is more than enough of this.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Choose one of your option with an effective and stable pH. Examples: Skinceuticals, Paula's Choice, Timeless, Melano CC, Tiam, etc || Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E improve stability and effectiveness.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Niacinamide:** It's gentler than Vitamin C and does many of the same things, but it's not as clear that it helps boost collagen. Repairs and prevents. Brightening so if you have discoloration it's great, and it's a heavy hitter for PIE and PIH. Reduces wrinkles, is antioxidant, helps with skin barrier, photo protective, reduces hyperpigmentation, anti-inflammatory... Want that luminous, ethereal glow? Bathe in this. (Joking, I wish I could.)\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Concentration up to 5% is more than ideal and enough. Above that it's not proven to be stronger. If paired with NAG it will be more effective &amp;amp;gt;) *^(Stratia Rewind, Shark Sauce, etc.)*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Hyaluronic Acid:** Brilliant as a humectant and hydrator. Reduces the appearance of lines/wrinkles by plumping the skin like no other. Paired with an occlusive to seal all the hydrating layers it will retain long lasting results.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Use the one of your choice. Hada Labo, Isntree, Elizavecca etc make great options that are simple and affordable.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Gentle Cleansing:** Can't stress this enough!!! Cleansing takes a huge toll on the skin if you believe it or not, so after making sure that you're using something that is low pH, choose the gentlest option possible. You're not supposed to feel stripped clean, just \\\\*soft\\\\* and clean!\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Avoid strong sulfates, harsh ingredients and high pH products. The gentler, the better.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Moisturizer:** A gel/cream/balm product that works for you, is a staple and that you can always return to. Oils are also emollient, and work well for many people to improve moisture. Urea is very moisturizing and is also a keratolytic. Emollience keeps the skin from getting dry, which causes wrinkles to be more apparent. Have one for the warmer and colder weather, and never, never skip this if you can. You need moisture, always, period.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is supposed to \\\\*moisturize\\\\* and keep your skin moisture levels in check and balanced. It's not supposed to be miraculous, just to work fine with your skin and keep it healthy, happy and soft.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Ceramides:** to keep that moisture barrier in top condition and your skin healthy so it heals faster and behaves better. There's a perfect ratio of 3:1:1 with cholesterol and fatty acids that is proven to be more effective for damaged skin, but it's helpful to always use some nevertheless, even if not as quick or effective.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Common recommendations here:) *^(Stratia Liquid Gold, Ceracolla/Rosette gel and lotions, Dr Jart Ceramidin line, Matsuyama toners, HolikaHolika Super Good Cera Emulsion/Cream, Kikumasamune, Cezanne and Mebika, Mochitto lotions, etc.)*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **AHAs:** exfoliate the skin by stimulating cell regrowth and collagen production by exfoliating the outer, tougher more aged layer of skin and thus reducing lines. They help maintaining the skin younger, but don't overdo them and take them lightly or you'll regret it. Con: make skin photosensitive, so you need **extra** sun protection at all times while using these. 20% glycolic acid is proven to stimulate collagen production.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Ph has to be effective to work, but don't overdo it and start low. Over-exfoliation and a damaged moisture barrier is no joke.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Occlusives:** These will keep the hydration in, preventing transepidermal water loss. Seal in all your hard work and keep your skin plump, moisturized, hydrated and repaired. Vaseline is the best in this category, and once you find a sealant that works for you, it will make a world of difference, I swear!!! Can't win against dehydrated skin if you don't seal it! Plus it reduces lines by making skin bouncy, glowing and plump.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Choose one of your choice. A sleeping pack or a proper occlusive like Vaseline, Aquaphor, Cerave Healing Ointment, LRP Cicaplast Gel, silicones, etc.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Peptides:** More specifically, Matrixyl 3000 and Matrixyl synthe'6, which help with prevention, repair and reversal. Copper peptides increase collagen production by 50% if used properly, but overdone and it can cause *more* damage than good and it can be expensive, so no need to use it too early.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Copper peptides: NIOD, Alpha H, TO. || Peptides: Dr Jart, PTR Un-Wrinkle Lotion, TO Matrixyl 10%, Timeless, etc)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Other options:*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3% DMAE:** applied daily for 16 weeks improved skin firmness significantly in vivo, helping with elastin loss.\\n\\n**Green tea:** Another antioxidant that can reverse UV damage and help with protection, but isn't very stable.\\n\\n**Q10/Ubiquinone:** another antioxidant that helps to prevent and repair those lines + UV protection.\\n\\n**Hydroquinone:** for age spots and hyperpigmentation. Use for three months and stop for three months before you start again.\\n\\n**2% Alpha Arbutin and Tranexamic Acid:** brightening, help with fading and evening out scars/skin tone.\\n\\n**Aloe Vera:** is very good for mending damages done by UV rays\\n\\n**Honey, licorice and propolis:** want glowy, hydrated and healthy skin? Look no further! Is antibacterial, healing and gives you *theGlow*.\\n\\n**Ginseng:** can be disputed, but is highly beloved by some\\n\\n**Snail:** Not really anti aging, but some say is healing and soothing. So it can make your skin bounce back from bad reactions and regenerate faster + heal better, plus it's hydrating and plumping.\\n\\n**Centella Asiatica:** healing, soothing, calming\\n\\n**0.1% madecassoside:** increases collagen type I synthesis\\n\\n**Ferments (ex. Bifida, Galactomyces):** users report a refined and brighter complexion after finding one that works for them\\n\\n**(Fraxel) Laser:** expensive, but has amazing results, especially with good skincare to maintain it. If you want to invest in 'skincare', this is the only thing truly worth it.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLastly,\\n\\n**Common sense**. You can't fight gravity and old age. Enjoy your life, try to avoid stress and be as happy as you can. Sleep well and eat well. Take care of your health and cherish it. Avoid tanning, smoking and drinking too much. Don't see the sun as your enemy, you need it. Build your routine slowly and stay consistent. Some ingredients/products may not give you results, and some actives might not work for you at all, so don't force it. Enjoy your routine and don't try out too much, skin doesn't like being disrupted and can lash back at you for that.Respect your skin, be kind to it and work with what you have, instead of having unreal expectations and taking it for granted.\\n\\n**My opinion**: It's all about the sync with ingredients and routine I guess, not only specific products. No need to splurge on very expensive products if you don't want to, as long as the core ingredients for most results are covered and you enjoy what you’re using! It's not about what you can afford, but choose to afford. :)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Check out these posts:**\\n\\n(!)

That's why they're greasier and thicker. For comparison, an AB sunscreen of PA++++ has a PPD of +16. **PPD** has a different role than SPF (for UVBs) and is used in preventing UVA rays' damage, which is what causes *aging, discoloration, wrinkles, freckles, dark spots* and *PIH* as a result of UVA exposure long term. The higher the PPD rating of the sunscreen, the better you will be protected from UVA rays. The lowest safe PPD is (I believe) 8, which blocks 87% of UVA rays. 30+ PPD blocks nearly 96% of UVA rays.\\n\\nI know that the only criteria most people look for is if it is lightweight matte or greasy finish but for anti-aging UVA protection is my primary concern along with a high SPF since I'm making the commitment to use sunscreen everyday anyways.

Lots of people wanted an update but I can't edit my last post so hopefully a new post is okay! Update is near the bottom lol. \\n\\nFirst to address things that I was asked/told a lot. I know I don't have to clarify but I feel compelled to do so. \\n\\n-Again, have to stress that I got this done for a medical condition, not cosmetically. Trigeminal Neuralgia affects the Trigeminal nerve in the face and causes significant pain. The purpose of Botox is to hopefully numb the nerve so my pain improves. \\n\\n-I have 4 neurological conditions. I have crazy neurological crap happen pretty constantly. When that happens you just naturally have to be more chill about things or you'll kill yourself from stress. I didn't realize that this was pretty extreme until I saw myself late afternoon/early evening yesterday when I made a video which is where my last image was from. But, again, I can't panic at these things so I researched and asking Reddit was part of my research until I could contact a doctor. \\n\\n-I was fairly confident I didn't have Bells Palsy and was certain I hadn't had a stroke. I had a stroke scare two years ago and the issues I had were much more severe (blurred vision, weakness, slurred speech) and I was told then what to look out for in the future. I still have full control of my eye on the affected side and nothing is changed there look wise which was why I wasn't quite worried about Bells Palsy. The only symptom I had/have is that extremely crooked smile. I was mostly concerned about a possibility of having been injected in the wrong spot and/or I had gotten too much Botox. \\n\\n-Lastly, the last time I saw my face before yesterday was Day 4 and it had a slight droop which I was told to possibly expect. Then Day 5 and 6, I had IVIG which involves getting medication via IV 2 days a month. It is really hard on me so I spend most of those two days sleeping through as much as I can. Then I usually need another day to rest which was Day 7. Thus why I didn't see my face again until Day 8, yesterday. \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay, so now the update. I called my Neurologist this morning and they said they'd call me back but didn't. I told them I had an extreme droop but who knows if who I talked to took that seriously or even relayed it that way. And again, a droop is normal after Botox for TN. As soon as I was able I went down to my neurologist's office anyway. The receptionist noticed how bad it was immediately and told me that my neurologist was finishing up an appointment. I sat in the lobby for like 15 mins and then she called me back. She admitted it was definitely more dropped than normal but she said it still wasn't unheared of for this treatment. She checked me out and didn't feel that I had Bells Palsy or had a stroke. She said that likely the MD who gave me the Botox gave me too much and too close to my mouth. She said that I should continue taking photos and video of me doing different facial expressions so that if I do happen to get it done again (I'm not sure I will) then the doctor will be able to see how it affected me and where to avoid. She also said they'll likely have to dilute the Botox even more than they did. She said it should slowly get better over the next 6-8 weeks. \\n\\nSo yeah, I'm okay y'all. Everything is good over here health wise. I just have to deal with looking insane in the interim. 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ If for some reason this ends up miraculously working really well then I will definitely look into having a cosmetic surgeon do the next treatment if my insurance will allow it.\", 'score': 4068, 'num_comments': 392, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/es423ls0zlzb1.jpg', 'post_id': '17shh9z'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Just turned 58', 'self_text': 'I’ve never worn makeup except for mascara so I am clueless but is there a product will help hide my uneven skin tone ?

In 2015 I went to the Victorian Cosmetic Institute & was talked into having 4mls of filler injected into my cheeks & nasolabial folds to lift my cheeks by self appointed \"cosmetic medicine specialist\" Dr Somaiye Kadivar. I was told that the filler was temporary & would last anywhere between 12-18 months.\\n\\nOnce the procedure was over I looked in the mirror & noticed one cheek was higher while the other cheek was lower & further out from my nose. My nasolabial folds were arched, crooked, unnatural & everytime I smiled my cheeks would pop out like golf balls. I hated the results because the filler added volume instead of a lift like I was led to believe.\\n\\nJust the thought of what I would have looked like if I had gone ahead with the 12 month \"alternative treatment plan” devised by the\\n\"cosmetic medicine specialist\" Dr Somaiye Kadivar who recommended 12mls of filler costing me over $9,000 and 60 units of Botox every 3 months for $720 per treatment gives me nightmares.\\n\\nSoon after I contacted the owner of the Victorian Cosmetic Institute Gavin Chan and complained about the botched filler. He assured me it was easily & instantly reversible by injecting Hyaluronidase which is used off label to dissolve fillers. After several attempts over the coming days & weeks it was quite obvious that the filler was still present.\\n\\nOn one occasion Gavin Chan dissolved my tear troughs via the cheeks yet I never had filler in my tear troughs to begin with. On another occasion while injecting Hyaluronidase he also started to inject filler into my temple without prior warning. When I asked him why he was injecting my temple he told me he was compensating me for my troubles yet never mentioned that the temple is a danger zone & a risky area to inject.\\n\\nIn total I had 6mls of filler injected into my face within 19 days, yet on the Victorian Cosmetic Institute\\'s website it states that 1ml of filler is enough for the entire face. On each occasion Gavin Chan never informed me of the risks, dangers & complications associated with Hyaluronidase & never gave me a consent form to read and sign.\\n\\nA few years later I had a consultation with Professor Mark Ashton who is an expert in filler complications & he told me that if the filler hadn\\'t dissolved by now then it was permanent. He gave me a referral for an MRI of the head which detects the exact amount of filler & the exact location of the filler. The MRI report stated that I still had upto 4mls of filler in my face even after all the dissolving sessions from many years ago.\\n\\nOn Dec 3rd 2018 I showed Gavin Chan my MRI results who had no idea at the time that MRI scans can detect fillers. His recommendation was more dissolving but in a larger dose so he flooded my face with Hyaluronidase yet never recorded the amount in my clinical notes.\\n\\nWhen I went back for a follow up consultation on Dec 10th 2018 he contacted radiologist Mobin Master in my presence who also appeared not to be aware at the time that MRI\\'s can detect filler but suggested I get another MRI anyway.\\n\\nNot long after, Gavin Chan contacted me via email thanking me for bringing the MRI information to his attention instead of thanking Professor Mark Ashton who he had previously corresponded with via email regarding my MRI results. For some unknown reason it did not occur to Gavin Chan that Professor Mark Ashton deserved all the credit for having known all along that MRI\\'s can detect dermal filler.\\n\\nInstead Gavin Chan chose to capitalise on this information by making a YouTube video claiming he had made this discovery after doing quite a few MRI\\'s (not sure how this is possible as he is not a radiologist). He also stated in his email that he wanted to inject a very high dose of Hyaluronidase to try and dissolve the filler again for the 5th time.\\n\\nIn the meantime I noticed that my facial structure had collapsed, I developed deep hollows under my eyes, my cheeks caved in, my marionette lines were deep, long & dragged down. The corners of my lips sunk into my mouth & my skin was extremely loose, saggy & stretchy all the way down to my neck.\\n\\nHyaluronidase did not dissolve my fillers but instead permanently dissolved my connective tissue as it can\\'t distinguish between the skin\\'s own HA & the HA in dermal fillers. Hyaluronidase has aged my facial features by 10 years & only a full facelift & necklift can fix this.\\n\\nIn 2019 & 2020 | took Gavin Chan to VCAT, a small claims court requesting a refund & a corrective advertising order because his website falsely advertised that the temporary fillers they use last anywhere between 12-18 months. Gavin Chan was granted lawyers on the grounds that his business reputation was at stake while I had to represent myself.\\n\\nI cross examined him with over 90 questions & I presented over 100 pages of supporting evidence & documentation while he only had photos & amended clinical notes. Mobin Master was also present in court supporting Gavin Chan. The hearing was held over 2 days & my claims were eventually dismissed by the judge.\\n\\nGavin Chan who \"specialises\" in cosmetic procedures got away with not providing a patch test for Hyaluronidase and not providing a consent form for Hyaluronidase on each occasion amongst other things.\\n\\nMobin Master who began posting the first MRI images on his\\nInstagram account 1 week after the first VCAT hearing in Nov 2019 now identifies as an \"aesthetic radiologist\" and a \"world pioneer\" in filler longevity.\\n\\nGavin Chan, the self appointed \"doctor trainer\" for various dermal fillers and anti-wrinkle injections and \"cosmetic surgeon\" as he once claimed to be isn\\'t even a GP, he is just a medical practitioner with no other formal training. His only qualification is a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery with a background in intensive care, anaesthesia and emergency medicine.\\n\\nGavin Chan who medically reviews his own articles has provided cosmetic procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections, dermal fillers, liposuction, facial fat transfers, skin needling and laser treatments since 2004 and has held advanced one-on-one injector training workshops for dermal fillers yet has no certificates or credentials listed on his Victorian Cosmetic Institute\\'s website.\\n\\nIn my opinion Gavin Chan has a special interest in portraying himself as the master of cosmetic injectables in an unregulated industry. He is an injectable junkie, obsessed with the syringe & makes no apologies for ruining my life. I hold Gavin Chan responsible for destroying my looks and my life.\\n\\nJust recently I was threatened on 2 occasions with legal action for posting Google reviews on Gavin Chan. His lawyers instructed me to remove each review within 7 days otherwise I would be sued for defamation in the Federal Court of Australia. I wasn\\'t even given a chance to respond to each email when my reviews were both taken down.\\n\\nI have no doubt in my mind that Gavin Chan was behind the removal of my reviews. Gavin Chan pays a lot of money to have my reviews removed as he doesn\\'t want anyone finding out the truth.\\n\\nIf you are a cosmetic injectable victim or want to be well informed regarding what can go wrong please join BOTCHED FILLERS & HYALURONIDASE DAMAGE SUPPORT GROUP on FB.', 'score': 3513, 'num_comments': 402, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1als23e', 'post_id': '1als23e'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Reminder to wear your sunscreen - Weird spot on turned out to be cancer', 'self_text': \"\\nI have a weird spot on my scalp, got it checked, and turns out it's white skin cancer (I'm 31 - we found it in an early stage so I will be fine.) \\n\\nBut please take this as a reminder to wear sunscreen daily on your face, chest, and hands (basically anything that's exposed) and to cover your head.\\n\\nThe doctor mentioned that he is seeing these kinds of cases more and more often in younger people.

The plastic surgeon Dr. Lara Devgan was renowned for her work with fillers. She uses Revanesse Versa which is an extremely dense, hydrophilic, long- lasting filler very similar to Voluma but cheaper. \\nThe filler looked good for 3-4 months and then I developed severe  facial edema and was eventually diagnosed with a delayed inflammatory/ hypersensitivity reaction to the filler.  I had not had COVID or any other viral illness. I’d had the vaccine six months before ever receiving filler. \\n\\nThe edema never went away. Dr. Devgan dropped me as a patient after lying to my face that filler couldn’t cause this. A CT scan, MRI, and multiple ultrasounds later proved that the filler had expanded and migrated literally all over my face. It was compromising my facial muscles and blocking my lymphatics— causing chronic swelling, poor skin quality, muscle weakness and chronic dry eye. \\n\\n I had to fly across the country to Seattle, WA, twice, to get it dissolved under ultrasound by a complications specialist. Well by then, it had been almost two years since the filler was injected. It had integrated into my tissue and I was informed that it would be impossible to remove all of it. Dissolving damaged my skin and caused systemic issues, reducing the swelling by only about 20%. \\n\\nI’m now left with semi permanent or permanent facial swelling and skin damage. \\n\\nFillers are a nightmare for some of us. For many people, it’s metabolized normally and effectively “goes away.”  For an ever increasing subset of patients, however,  it can trigger a serious autoimmune reaction  which is impossible to calm down if there is even a little piece still floating around. In these patients, the filler is not metabolized correctly and instead migrates , swells and expands. I’ve been told it will take 10-20 years or it will never go away.  The damage is likely irreversible. I’m only 29. \\n\\nDoctors aren’t there for you when you have complications from this procedure, because it’s really the bread and butter of their industry .

I've been researching this too and because I can't develop any interest without getting obsessively curious about it for a while, I ended up learning, uh, a lot. There's really no magical products, but good formulations of certain ingredients that work.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all:\\n\\nConsistency is key. **Cleanse, treat, protect.**\\n\\nEvery day.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ Before anything, **SUNSCREEN**. While those light and invisible AB ones are more elegant, if you really want to fight that UVA destruction, use a high PPD one to protect your skin the most. If you don't care about that, consistency is key but remember to use a stronger sports one for longer sun exposure. This is basically your shield of Avalon, your lifelong investment that will pay off in the end. No matter what else you use and how much you spend on skincare, if you don't use sunscreen, it will be useless. Go out in daylight and enjoy your life, but protect your face, neck and chest at least.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Use the one of your choice, preferably with stable and good filters, starting with SPF50 and at least PPD16 or PA++++.) ^(|| I’d recommend to use one with high PPD because I care more about longterm UVA protection than cosmetic elegance, just make sure you have one you like, especially if you have a perma-tan or face darker than your body. But.) **^(THE BEST SUNSCREEN IS THE ONE YOU’LL USE.)**\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Tretinoin:** If sunscreen is your shield, this is your Excalibur and heavy hitter. It will refine texture, prevent lines, *reverse* damage, even out, brighten and perfect your skin as realistically possible. It's harsh, irritating and strong at first, but it works and it shows. You have to stay on life for this though to continue to gather benefits, but those anti aging products are minions compared to this Titan and its results. It makes the skin photosensitive, so you can't skip sunscreen at all or it will do more damage than good (!!!). Use only at night. Keep yourself hydrated and moisturized properly or it will damage your moisture barrier.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Start with alternate usage and slowly increase until your skin gets used to it. 0.025% is more than enough for anti-aging.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Vitamin C:** The best antioxidant you can use, especifically in the form of L-AA (Ascorbic Acid). Brightens discoloration, fades scars, evens out skin tone and pigmentation, encourages collagen growth and helps repair, prevent and reverse UV damage. Once a day is more than enough of this.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Choose one of your option with an effective and stable pH. Examples: Skinceuticals, Paula's Choice, Timeless, Melano CC, Tiam, etc || Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E improve stability and effectiveness.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Niacinamide:** It's gentler than Vitamin C and does many of the same things, but it's not as clear that it helps boost collagen. Repairs and prevents. Brightening so if you have discoloration it's great, and it's a heavy hitter for PIE and PIH. Reduces wrinkles, is antioxidant, helps with skin barrier, photo protective, reduces hyperpigmentation, anti-inflammatory... Want that luminous, ethereal glow? Bathe in this. (Joking, I wish I could.)\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Concentration up to 5% is more than ideal and enough. Above that it's not proven to be stronger. If paired with NAG it will be more effective &amp;amp;gt;) *^(Stratia Rewind, Shark Sauce, etc.)*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Hyaluronic Acid:** Brilliant as a humectant and hydrator. Reduces the appearance of lines/wrinkles by plumping the skin like no other. Paired with an occlusive to seal all the hydrating layers it will retain long lasting results.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Use the one of your choice. Hada Labo, Isntree, Elizavecca etc make great options that are simple and affordable.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Gentle Cleansing:** Can't stress this enough!!! Cleansing takes a huge toll on the skin if you believe it or not, so after making sure that you're using something that is low pH, choose the gentlest option possible. You're not supposed to feel stripped clean, just \\\\*soft\\\\* and clean!\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Avoid strong sulfates, harsh ingredients and high pH products. The gentler, the better.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Moisturizer:** A gel/cream/balm product that works for you, is a staple and that you can always return to. Oils are also emollient, and work well for many people to improve moisture. Urea is very moisturizing and is also a keratolytic. Emollience keeps the skin from getting dry, which causes wrinkles to be more apparent. Have one for the warmer and colder weather, and never, never skip this if you can. You need moisture, always, period.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is supposed to \\\\*moisturize\\\\* and keep your skin moisture levels in check and balanced. It's not supposed to be miraculous, just to work fine with your skin and keep it healthy, happy and soft.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Ceramides:** to keep that moisture barrier in top condition and your skin healthy so it heals faster and behaves better. There's a perfect ratio of 3:1:1 with cholesterol and fatty acids that is proven to be more effective for damaged skin, but it's helpful to always use some nevertheless, even if not as quick or effective.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Common recommendations here:) *^(Stratia Liquid Gold, Ceracolla/Rosette gel and lotions, Dr Jart Ceramidin line, Matsuyama toners, HolikaHolika Super Good Cera Emulsion/Cream, Kikumasamune, Cezanne and Mebika, Mochitto lotions, etc.)*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **AHAs:** exfoliate the skin by stimulating cell regrowth and collagen production by exfoliating the outer, tougher more aged layer of skin and thus reducing lines. They help maintaining the skin younger, but don't overdo them and take them lightly or you'll regret it. Con: make skin photosensitive, so you need **extra** sun protection at all times while using these. 20% glycolic acid is proven to stimulate collagen production.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Ph has to be effective to work, but don't overdo it and start low. Over-exfoliation and a damaged moisture barrier is no joke.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Occlusives:** These will keep the hydration in, preventing transepidermal water loss. Seal in all your hard work and keep your skin plump, moisturized, hydrated and repaired. Vaseline is the best in this category, and once you find a sealant that works for you, it will make a world of difference, I swear!!! Can't win against dehydrated skin if you don't seal it! Plus it reduces lines by making skin bouncy, glowing and plump.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Choose one of your choice. A sleeping pack or a proper occlusive like Vaseline, Aquaphor, Cerave Healing Ointment, LRP Cicaplast Gel, silicones, etc.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Peptides:** More specifically, Matrixyl 3000 and Matrixyl synthe'6, which help with prevention, repair and reversal. Copper peptides increase collagen production by 50% if used properly, but overdone and it can cause *more* damage than good and it can be expensive, so no need to use it too early.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Copper peptides: NIOD, Alpha H, TO. || Peptides: Dr Jart, PTR Un-Wrinkle Lotion, TO Matrixyl 10%, Timeless, etc)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Other options:*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3% DMAE:** applied daily for 16 weeks improved skin firmness significantly in vivo, helping with elastin loss.\\n\\n**Green tea:** Another antioxidant that can reverse UV damage and help with protection, but isn't very stable.\\n\\n**Q10/Ubiquinone:** another antioxidant that helps to prevent and repair those lines + UV protection.\\n\\n**Hydroquinone:** for age spots and hyperpigmentation. Use for three months and stop for three months before you start again.\\n\\n**2% Alpha Arbutin and Tranexamic Acid:** brightening, help with fading and evening out scars/skin tone.\\n\\n**Aloe Vera:** is very good for mending damages done by UV rays\\n\\n**Honey, licorice and propolis:** want glowy, hydrated and healthy skin? Look no further! Is antibacterial, healing and gives you *theGlow*.\\n\\n**Ginseng:** can be disputed, but is highly beloved by some\\n\\n**Snail:** Not really anti aging, but some say is healing and soothing. So it can make your skin bounce back from bad reactions and regenerate faster + heal better, plus it's hydrating and plumping.\\n\\n**Centella Asiatica:** healing, soothing, calming\\n\\n**0.1% madecassoside:** increases collagen type I synthesis\\n\\n**Ferments (ex. Bifida, Galactomyces):** users report a refined and brighter complexion after finding one that works for them\\n\\n**(Fraxel) Laser:** expensive, but has amazing results, especially with good skincare to maintain it. If you want to invest in 'skincare', this is the only thing truly worth it.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLastly,\\n\\n**Common sense**. You can't fight gravity and old age. Enjoy your life, try to avoid stress and be as happy as you can. Sleep well and eat well. Take care of your health and cherish it. Avoid tanning, smoking and drinking too much. Don't see the sun as your enemy, you need it. Build your routine slowly and stay consistent. Some ingredients/products may not give you results, and some actives might not work for you at all, so don't force it. Enjoy your routine and don't try out too much, skin doesn't like being disrupted and can lash back at you for that.Respect your skin, be kind to it and work with what you have, instead of having unreal expectations and taking it for granted.\\n\\n**My opinion**: It's all about the sync with ingredients and routine I guess, not only specific products. No need to splurge on very expensive products if you don't want to, as long as the core ingredients for most results are covered and you enjoy what you’re using! It's not about what you can afford, but choose to afford. :)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Check out these posts:**\\n\\n(!)

That's why they're greasier and thicker. For comparison, an AB sunscreen of PA++++ has a PPD of +16. **PPD** has a different role than SPF (for UVBs) and is used in preventing UVA rays' damage, which is what causes *aging, discoloration, wrinkles, freckles, dark spots* and *PIH* as a result of UVA exposure long term. The higher the PPD rating of the sunscreen, the better you will be protected from UVA rays. The lowest safe PPD is (I believe) 8, which blocks 87% of UVA rays. 30+ PPD blocks nearly 96% of UVA rays.\\n\\nI know that the only criteria most people look for is if it is lightweight matte or greasy finish but for anti-aging UVA protection is my primary concern along with a high SPF since I'm making the commitment to use sunscreen everyday anyways.

Lots of people wanted an update but I can't edit my last post so hopefully a new post is okay! Update is near the bottom lol. \\n\\nFirst to address things that I was asked/told a lot. I know I don't have to clarify but I feel compelled to do so. \\n\\n-Again, have to stress that I got this done for a medical condition, not cosmetically. Trigeminal Neuralgia affects the Trigeminal nerve in the face and causes significant pain. The purpose of Botox is to hopefully numb the nerve so my pain improves. \\n\\n-I have 4 neurological conditions. I have crazy neurological crap happen pretty constantly. When that happens you just naturally have to be more chill about things or you'll kill yourself from stress. I didn't realize that this was pretty extreme until I saw myself late afternoon/early evening yesterday when I made a video which is where my last image was from. But, again, I can't panic at these things so I researched and asking Reddit was part of my research until I could contact a doctor. \\n\\n-I was fairly confident I didn't have Bells Palsy and was certain I hadn't had a stroke. I had a stroke scare two years ago and the issues I had were much more severe (blurred vision, weakness, slurred speech) and I was told then what to look out for in the future. I still have full control of my eye on the affected side and nothing is changed there look wise which was why I wasn't quite worried about Bells Palsy. The only symptom I had/have is that extremely crooked smile. I was mostly concerned about a possibility of having been injected in the wrong spot and/or I had gotten too much Botox. \\n\\n-Lastly, the last time I saw my face before yesterday was Day 4 and it had a slight droop which I was told to possibly expect. Then Day 5 and 6, I had IVIG which involves getting medication via IV 2 days a month. It is really hard on me so I spend most of those two days sleeping through as much as I can. Then I usually need another day to rest which was Day 7. Thus why I didn't see my face again until Day 8, yesterday. \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay, so now the update. I called my Neurologist this morning and they said they'd call me back but didn't. I told them I had an extreme droop but who knows if who I talked to took that seriously or even relayed it that way. And again, a droop is normal after Botox for TN. As soon as I was able I went down to my neurologist's office anyway. The receptionist noticed how bad it was immediately and told me that my neurologist was finishing up an appointment. I sat in the lobby for like 15 mins and then she called me back. She admitted it was definitely more dropped than normal but she said it still wasn't unheared of for this treatment. She checked me out and didn't feel that I had Bells Palsy or had a stroke. She said that likely the MD who gave me the Botox gave me too much and too close to my mouth. She said that I should continue taking photos and video of me doing different facial expressions so that if I do happen to get it done again (I'm not sure I will) then the doctor will be able to see how it affected me and where to avoid. She also said they'll likely have to dilute the Botox even more than they did. She said it should slowly get better over the next 6-8 weeks. \\n\\nSo yeah, I'm okay y'all.

In 2015 I went to the Victorian Cosmetic Institute & was talked into having 4mls of filler injected into my cheeks & nasolabial folds to lift my cheeks by self appointed \"cosmetic medicine specialist\" Dr Somaiye Kadivar. I was told that the filler was temporary & would last anywhere between 12-18 months.\\n\\nOnce the procedure was over I looked in the mirror & noticed one cheek was higher while the other cheek was lower & further out from my nose. My nasolabial folds were arched, crooked, unnatural & everytime I smiled my cheeks would pop out like golf balls. I hated the results because the filler added volume instead of a lift like I was led to believe.\\n\\nJust the thought of what I would have looked like if I had gone ahead with the 12 month \"alternative treatment plan” devised by the\\n\"cosmetic medicine specialist\" Dr Somaiye Kadivar who recommended 12mls of filler costing me over $9,000 and 60 units of Botox every 3 months for $720 per treatment gives me nightmares.\\n\\nSoon after I contacted the owner of the Victorian Cosmetic Institute Gavin Chan and complained about the botched filler. He assured me it was easily & instantly reversible by injecting Hyaluronidase which is used off label to dissolve fillers. After several attempts over the coming days & weeks it was quite obvious that the filler was still present.\\n\\nOn one occasion Gavin Chan dissolved my tear troughs via the cheeks yet I never had filler in my tear troughs to begin with. On another occasion while injecting Hyaluronidase he also started to inject filler into my temple without prior warning. When I asked him why he was injecting my temple he told me he was compensating me for my troubles yet never mentioned that the temple is a danger zone & a risky area to inject.\\n\\nIn total I had 6mls of filler injected into my face within 19 days, yet on the Victorian Cosmetic Institute\\'s website it states that 1ml of filler is enough for the entire face. On each occasion Gavin Chan never informed me of the risks, dangers & complications associated with Hyaluronidase & never gave me a consent form to read and sign.\\n\\nA few years later I had a consultation with Professor Mark Ashton who is an expert in filler complications & he told me that if the filler hadn\\'t dissolved by now then it was permanent. He gave me a referral for an MRI of the head which detects the exact amount of filler & the exact location of the filler. The MRI report stated that I still had upto 4mls of filler in my face even after all the dissolving sessions from many years ago.\\n\\nOn Dec 3rd 2018 I showed Gavin Chan my MRI results who had no idea at the time that MRI scans can detect fillers. His recommendation was more dissolving but in a larger dose so he flooded my face with Hyaluronidase yet never recorded the amount in my clinical notes.\\n\\nWhen I went back for a follow up consultation on Dec 10th 2018 he contacted radiologist Mobin Master in my presence who also appeared not to be aware at the time that MRI\\'s can detect filler but suggested I get another MRI anyway.\\n\\nNot long after, Gavin Chan contacted me via email thanking me for bringing the MRI information to his attention instead of thanking Professor Mark Ashton who he had previously corresponded with via email regarding my MRI results. For some unknown reason it did not occur to Gavin Chan that Professor Mark Ashton deserved all the credit for having known all along that MRI\\'s can detect dermal filler.\\n\\nInstead Gavin Chan chose to capitalise on this information by making a YouTube video claiming he had made this discovery after doing quite a few MRI\\'s (not sure how this is possible as he is not a radiologist). He also stated in his email that he wanted to inject a very high dose of Hyaluronidase to try and dissolve the filler again for the 5th time.\\n\\nIn the meantime I noticed that my facial structure had collapsed, I developed deep hollows under my eyes, my cheeks caved in, my marionette lines were deep, long & dragged down. The corners of my lips sunk into my mouth & my skin was extremely loose, saggy & stretchy all the way down to my neck.\\n\\nHyaluronidase did not dissolve my fillers but instead permanently dissolved my connective tissue as it can\\'t distinguish between the skin\\'s own HA & the HA in dermal fillers. Hyaluronidase has aged my facial features by 10 years & only a full facelift & necklift can fix this.\\n\\nIn 2019 & 2020 | took Gavin Chan to VCAT, a small claims court requesting a refund & a corrective advertising order because his website falsely advertised that the temporary fillers they use last anywhere between 12-18 months. Gavin Chan was granted lawyers on the grounds that his business reputation was at stake while I had to represent myself.\\n\\nI cross examined him with over 90 questions & I presented over 100 pages of supporting evidence & documentation while he only had photos & amended clinical notes. Mobin Master was also present in court supporting Gavin Chan. The hearing was held over 2 days & my claims were eventually dismissed by the judge.\\n\\nGavin Chan who \"specialises\" in cosmetic procedures got away with not providing a patch test for Hyaluronidase and not providing a consent form for Hyaluronidase on each occasion amongst other things.\\n\\nMobin Master who began posting the first MRI images on his\\nInstagram account 1 week after the first VCAT hearing in Nov 2019 now identifies as an \"aesthetic radiologist\" and a \"world pioneer\" in filler longevity.\\n\\nGavin Chan, the self appointed \"doctor trainer\" for various dermal fillers and anti-wrinkle injections and \"cosmetic surgeon\" as he once claimed to be isn\\'t even a GP, he is just a medical practitioner with no other formal training. His only qualification is a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery with a background in intensive care, anaesthesia and emergency medicine.\\n\\nGavin Chan who medically reviews his own articles has provided cosmetic procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections, dermal fillers, liposuction, facial fat transfers, skin needling and laser treatments since 2004 and has held advanced one-on-one injector training workshops for dermal fillers yet has no certificates or credentials listed on his Victorian Cosmetic Institute\\'s website.\\n\\nIn my opinion Gavin Chan has a special interest in portraying himself as the master of cosmetic injectables in an unregulated industry. He is an injectable junkie, obsessed with the syringe & makes no apologies for ruining my life. I hold Gavin Chan responsible for destroying my looks and my life.\\n\\nJust recently I was threatened on 2 occasions with legal action for posting Google reviews on Gavin Chan. His lawyers instructed me to remove each review within 7 days otherwise I would be sued for defamation in the Federal Court of Australia. I wasn\\'t even given a chance to respond to each email when my reviews were both taken down.\\n\\nI have no doubt in my mind that Gavin Chan was behind the removal of my reviews. Gavin Chan pays a lot of money to have my reviews removed as he doesn\\'t want anyone finding out the truth.\\n\\nIf you are a cosmetic injectable victim or want to be well informed regarding what can go wrong please join BOTCHED FILLERS & HYALURONIDASE DAMAGE SUPPORT GROUP on FB.', 'upvotes': 3517, 'num_comments': 402, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1als23e'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Reminder to wear your sunscreen - Weird spot on turned out to be cancer', 'body': \"\\nI have a weird spot on my scalp, got it checked, and turns out it's white skin cancer (I'm 31 - we found it in an early stage so I will be fine.) \\n\\nBut please take this as a reminder to wear sunscreen daily on your face, chest, and hands (basically anything that's exposed) and to cover your head.\\n\\nThe doctor mentioned that he is seeing these kinds of cases more and more often in younger people.

The plastic surgeon Dr. Lara Devgan was renowned for her work with fillers. She uses Revanesse Versa which is an extremely dense, hydrophilic, long- lasting filler very similar to Voluma but cheaper. \\nThe filler looked good for 3-4 months and then I developed severe  facial edema and was eventually diagnosed with a delayed inflammatory/ hypersensitivity reaction to the filler.  I had not had COVID or any other viral illness. I’d had the vaccine six months before ever receiving filler. \\n\\nThe edema never went away. Dr. Devgan dropped me as a patient after lying to my face that filler couldn’t cause this. A CT scan, MRI, and multiple ultrasounds later proved that the filler had expanded and migrated literally all over my face. It was compromising my facial muscles and blocking my lymphatics— causing chronic swelling, poor skin quality, muscle weakness and chronic dry eye. \\n\\n I had to fly across the country to Seattle, WA, twice, to get it dissolved under ultrasound by a complications specialist. Well by then, it had been almost two years since the filler was injected. It had integrated into my tissue and I was informed that it would be impossible to remove all of it. Dissolving damaged my skin and caused systemic issues, reducing the swelling by only about 20%. \\n\\nI’m now left with semi permanent or permanent facial swelling and skin damage. \\n\\nFillers are a nightmare for some of us. For many people, it’s metabolized normally and effectively “goes away.”  For an ever increasing subset of patients, however,  it can trigger a serious autoimmune reaction  which is impossible to calm down if there is even a little piece still floating around. In these patients, the filler is not metabolized correctly and instead migrates , swells and expands. I’ve been told it will take 10-20 years or it will never go away.  The damage is likely irreversible. I’m only 29. \\n\\nDoctors aren’t there for you when you have complications from this procedure, because it’s really the bread and butter of their industry .

It will spread to other parts of your body through your hands\\n\\n-blink rapidly to make your eyes tear up. DO NOT RUB YOUR EYES\\n\\n-wash your face (or affected area) with cleansing SOAP and rinse with cool water for 3-5 minutes. Pepper spray is oil based, so water alone won’t help long term (although it might provide instant relief) you need oil removing soap. (Even dish soap like dawn works)\\n\\n-don’t let the water you are flushing the affected area with trickle down the rest of your body, this will spread the pepper spray. \\n\\n-use “no tears” baby shampoo to rinse the eye area.\\n\\nFOR TEAR GAS:\\n\\n-the powder in tear gas clings to mucus/bodily fluids. makeup has a similar consistency. So don’t wear makeup to protest, as well as oil-based sunscreen. EDIT: if it’s sunny and you don’t have non oil-based sunscreen still use any sunscreen because tear gas/pepper spray on top of sunburn is worse.\\n\\n-ABSOLUTELY no contact lenses, take them out with clean fingers before the protest. The powder can get stuck between the contact lens and the eye \\n\\nAfter exposure:\\n\\n-spray your face/ affected area with baking soda and water mixture. Three teaspoons for every 8.5 oz of water.  (There is a lack of scientific ev, but people claim it works)  EDIT: careful with this around the eyes, make sure the baking soda is completely dissolved before use\\n\\n-take off shoes/clothes before entering your home so that you do not spread the powder. Keep clothes outside for 2-5 days, wash them without anything else in the washing machine, twice.\\n\\n-20 minute cold shower, this prevents the tear gas from further irritating your skin. \\n\\n#BLACKLIVESMATTER', 'upvotes': 10862, 'num_comments': 333, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gvbdyy/psa_skin_care_for_protesters/'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Humor] I feel personally attacked', 'body': '', 'upvotes': 10805, 'num_comments': 78, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/5shw16ktz6b31.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[humor] Actual picture of me heading to bed after putting on my 4 different moisturizers and using my marula, rosehip, and squalane oils.', 'body': '', 'upvotes': 10604, 'num_comments': 161, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/dluokvjlha041.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Puberty is making [Acne] hit hard but we’re trying to get through it with positive vibes :) Can’t wait to visit a dermatologist', 'body': '', 'upvotes': 10506, 'num_comments': 435, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/o74bastn0iq41.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Before&After] Severely scarred Accutane poster skin update and new routine.', 'body': '', 'upvotes': 10479, 'num_comments': 361, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/tmlwpa5kdqr01.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Humor] it be like that', 'body': '', 'upvotes': 10456, 'num_comments': 108, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/cgfoe90sfiq31.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': '[Humor] SPF > all other skincare', 'body': '', 'upvotes': 10380, 'num_comments': 416, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/lrccxnwvnm851.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'My mom opened her care package tonight.

I've been researching this too and because I can't develop any interest without getting obsessively curious about it for a while, I ended up learning, uh, a lot. There's really no magical products, but good formulations of certain ingredients that work.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirst of all:\\n\\nConsistency is key. **Cleanse, treat, protect.**\\n\\nEvery day.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ Before anything, **SUNSCREEN**. While those light and invisible AB ones are more elegant, if you really want to fight that UVA destruction, use a high PPD one to protect your skin the most. If you don't care about that, consistency is key but remember to use a stronger sports one for longer sun exposure. This is basically your shield of Avalon, your lifelong investment that will pay off in the end. No matter what else you use and how much you spend on skincare, if you don't use sunscreen, it will be useless. Go out in daylight and enjoy your life, but protect your face, neck and chest at least.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Use the one of your choice, preferably with stable and good filters, starting with SPF50 and at least PPD16 or PA++++.) ^(|| I’d recommend to use one with high PPD because I care more about longterm UVA protection than cosmetic elegance, just make sure you have one you like, especially if you have a perma-tan or face darker than your body. But.) **^(THE BEST SUNSCREEN IS THE ONE YOU’LL USE.)**\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Tretinoin:** If sunscreen is your shield, this is your Excalibur and heavy hitter. It will refine texture, prevent lines, *reverse* damage, even out, brighten and perfect your skin as realistically possible. It's harsh, irritating and strong at first, but it works and it shows. You have to stay on life for this though to continue to gather benefits, but those anti aging products are minions compared to this Titan and its results. It makes the skin photosensitive, so you can't skip sunscreen at all or it will do more damage than good (!!!). Use only at night. Keep yourself hydrated and moisturized properly or it will damage your moisture barrier.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Start with alternate usage and slowly increase until your skin gets used to it. 0.025% is more than enough for anti-aging.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Vitamin C:** The best antioxidant you can use, especifically in the form of L-AA (Ascorbic Acid). Brightens discoloration, fades scars, evens out skin tone and pigmentation, encourages collagen growth and helps repair, prevent and reverse UV damage. Once a day is more than enough of this.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Choose one of your option with an effective and stable pH. Examples: Skinceuticals, Paula's Choice, Timeless, Melano CC, Tiam, etc || Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E improve stability and effectiveness.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Niacinamide:** It's gentler than Vitamin C and does many of the same things, but it's not as clear that it helps boost collagen. Repairs and prevents. Brightening so if you have discoloration it's great, and it's a heavy hitter for PIE and PIH. Reduces wrinkles, is antioxidant, helps with skin barrier, photo protective, reduces hyperpigmentation, anti-inflammatory... Want that luminous, ethereal glow? Bathe in this. (Joking, I wish I could.)\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Concentration up to 5% is more than ideal and enough. Above that it's not proven to be stronger. If paired with NAG it will be more effective &amp;amp;gt;) *^(Stratia Rewind, Shark Sauce, etc.)*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Hyaluronic Acid:** Brilliant as a humectant and hydrator. Reduces the appearance of lines/wrinkles by plumping the skin like no other. Paired with an occlusive to seal all the hydrating layers it will retain long lasting results.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Use the one of your choice. Hada Labo, Isntree, Elizavecca etc make great options that are simple and affordable.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Gentle Cleansing:** Can't stress this enough!!! Cleansing takes a huge toll on the skin if you believe it or not, so after making sure that you're using something that is low pH, choose the gentlest option possible. You're not supposed to feel stripped clean, just \\\\*soft\\\\* and clean!\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Avoid strong sulfates, harsh ingredients and high pH products. The gentler, the better.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Moisturizer:** A gel/cream/balm product that works for you, is a staple and that you can always return to. Oils are also emollient, and work well for many people to improve moisture. Urea is very moisturizing and is also a keratolytic. Emollience keeps the skin from getting dry, which causes wrinkles to be more apparent. Have one for the warmer and colder weather, and never, never skip this if you can. You need moisture, always, period.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is supposed to \\\\*moisturize\\\\* and keep your skin moisture levels in check and balanced. It's not supposed to be miraculous, just to work fine with your skin and keep it healthy, happy and soft.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Ceramides:** to keep that moisture barrier in top condition and your skin healthy so it heals faster and behaves better. There's a perfect ratio of 3:1:1 with cholesterol and fatty acids that is proven to be more effective for damaged skin, but it's helpful to always use some nevertheless, even if not as quick or effective.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Common recommendations here:) *^(Stratia Liquid Gold, Ceracolla/Rosette gel and lotions, Dr Jart Ceramidin line, Matsuyama toners, HolikaHolika Super Good Cera Emulsion/Cream, Kikumasamune, Cezanne and Mebika, Mochitto lotions, etc.)*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **AHAs:** exfoliate the skin by stimulating cell regrowth and collagen production by exfoliating the outer, tougher more aged layer of skin and thus reducing lines. They help maintaining the skin younger, but don't overdo them and take them lightly or you'll regret it. Con: make skin photosensitive, so you need **extra** sun protection at all times while using these. 20% glycolic acid is proven to stimulate collagen production.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Ph has to be effective to work, but don't overdo it and start low. Over-exfoliation and a damaged moisture barrier is no joke.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Occlusives:** These will keep the hydration in, preventing transepidermal water loss. Seal in all your hard work and keep your skin plump, moisturized, hydrated and repaired. Vaseline is the best in this category, and once you find a sealant that works for you, it will make a world of difference, I swear!!! Can't win against dehydrated skin if you don't seal it! Plus it reduces lines by making skin bouncy, glowing and plump.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Choose one of your choice. A sleeping pack or a proper occlusive like Vaseline, Aquaphor, Cerave Healing Ointment, LRP Cicaplast Gel, silicones, etc.)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n⭐️ **Peptides:** More specifically, Matrixyl 3000 and Matrixyl synthe'6, which help with prevention, repair and reversal. Copper peptides increase collagen production by 50% if used properly, but overdone and it can cause *more* damage than good and it can be expensive, so no need to use it too early.\\n\\n^(&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Copper peptides: NIOD, Alpha H, TO. || Peptides: Dr Jart, PTR Un-Wrinkle Lotion, TO Matrixyl 10%, Timeless, etc)\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Other options:*\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3% DMAE:** applied daily for 16 weeks improved skin firmness significantly in vivo, helping with elastin loss.\\n\\n**Green tea:** Another antioxidant that can reverse UV damage and help with protection, but isn't very stable.\\n\\n**Q10/Ubiquinone:** another antioxidant that helps to prevent and repair those lines + UV protection.\\n\\n**Hydroquinone:** for age spots and hyperpigmentation. Use for three months and stop for three months before you start again.\\n\\n**2% Alpha Arbutin and Tranexamic Acid:** brightening, help with fading and evening out scars/skin tone.\\n\\n**Aloe Vera:** is very good for mending damages done by UV rays\\n\\n**Honey, licorice and propolis:** want glowy, hydrated and healthy skin? Look no further! Is antibacterial, healing and gives you *theGlow*.\\n\\n**Ginseng:** can be disputed, but is highly beloved by some\\n\\n**Snail:** Not really anti aging, but some say is healing and soothing. So it can make your skin bounce back from bad reactions and regenerate faster + heal better, plus it's hydrating and plumping.\\n\\n**Centella Asiatica:** healing, soothing, calming\\n\\n**0.1% madecassoside:** increases collagen type I synthesis\\n\\n**Ferments (ex. Bifida, Galactomyces):** users report a refined and brighter complexion after finding one that works for them\\n\\n**(Fraxel) Laser:** expensive, but has amazing results, especially with good skincare to maintain it. If you want to invest in 'skincare', this is the only thing truly worth it.\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\+\\n\\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLastly,\\n\\n**Common sense**. You can't fight gravity and old age. Enjoy your life, try to avoid stress and be as happy as you can. Sleep well and eat well. Take care of your health and cherish it. Avoid tanning, smoking and drinking too much. Don't see the sun as your enemy, you need it. Build your routine slowly and stay consistent. Some ingredients/products may not give you results, and some actives might not work for you at all, so don't force it. Enjoy your routine and don't try out too much, skin doesn't like being disrupted and can lash back at you for that.Respect your skin, be kind to it and work with what you have, instead of having unreal expectations and taking it for granted.\\n\\n**My opinion**: It's all about the sync with ingredients and routine I guess, not only specific products.

That's why they're greasier and thicker. For comparison, an AB sunscreen of PA++++ has a PPD of +16. **PPD** has a different role than SPF (for UVBs) and is used in preventing UVA rays' damage, which is what causes *aging, discoloration, wrinkles, freckles, dark spots* and *PIH* as a result of UVA exposure long term. The higher the PPD rating of the sunscreen, the better you will be protected from UVA rays. The lowest safe PPD is (I believe) 8, which blocks 87% of UVA rays. 30+ PPD blocks nearly 96% of UVA rays.\\n\\nI know that the only criteria most people look for is if it is lightweight matte or greasy finish but for anti-aging UVA protection is my primary concern along with a high SPF since I'm making the commitment to use sunscreen everyday anyways.

Lots of people wanted an update but I can't edit my last post so hopefully a new post is okay! Update is near the bottom lol. \\n\\nFirst to address things that I was asked/told a lot. I know I don't have to clarify but I feel compelled to do so. \\n\\n-Again, have to stress that I got this done for a medical condition, not cosmetically. Trigeminal Neuralgia affects the Trigeminal nerve in the face and causes significant pain. The purpose of Botox is to hopefully numb the nerve so my pain improves. \\n\\n-I have 4 neurological conditions. I have crazy neurological crap happen pretty constantly. When that happens you just naturally have to be more chill about things or you'll kill yourself from stress. I didn't realize that this was pretty extreme until I saw myself late afternoon/early evening yesterday when I made a video which is where my last image was from. But, again, I can't panic at these things so I researched and asking Reddit was part of my research until I could contact a doctor. \\n\\n-I was fairly confident I didn't have Bells Palsy and was certain I hadn't had a stroke. I had a stroke scare two years ago and the issues I had were much more severe (blurred vision, weakness, slurred speech) and I was told then what to look out for in the future. I still have full control of my eye on the affected side and nothing is changed there look wise which was why I wasn't quite worried about Bells Palsy. The only symptom I had/have is that extremely crooked smile. I was mostly concerned about a possibility of having been injected in the wrong spot and/or I had gotten too much Botox. \\n\\n-Lastly, the last time I saw my face before yesterday was Day 4 and it had a slight droop which I was told to possibly expect. Then Day 5 and 6, I had IVIG which involves getting medication via IV 2 days a month. It is really hard on me so I spend most of those two days sleeping through as much as I can. Then I usually need another day to rest which was Day 7. Thus why I didn't see my face again until Day 8, yesterday. \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOkay, so now the update. I called my Neurologist this morning and they said they'd call me back but didn't. I told them I had an extreme droop but who knows if who I talked to took that seriously or even relayed it that way. And again, a droop is normal after Botox for TN. As soon as I was able I went down to my neurologist's office anyway. The receptionist noticed how bad it was immediately and told me that my neurologist was finishing up an appointment. I sat in the lobby for like 15 mins and then she called me back. She admitted it was definitely more dropped than normal but she said it still wasn't unheared of for this treatment. She checked me out and didn't feel that I had Bells Palsy or had a stroke. She said that likely the MD who gave me the Botox gave me too much and too close to my mouth. She said that I should continue taking photos and video of me doing different facial expressions so that if I do happen to get it done again (I'm not sure I will) then the doctor will be able to see how it affected me and where to avoid. She also said they'll likely have to dilute the Botox even more than they did. She said it should slowly get better over the next 6-8 weeks. \\n\\nSo yeah, I'm okay y'all. Everything is good over here health wise. I just have to deal with looking insane in the interim. 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ If for some reason this ends up miraculously working really well then I will definitely look into having a cosmetic surgeon do the next treatment if my insurance will allow it.\", 'upvotes': 4064, 'num_comments': 392, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/es423ls0zlzb1.jpg'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Just turned 58', 'body': 'I’ve never worn makeup except for mascara so I am clueless but is there a product will help hide my uneven skin tone ?

In 2015 I went to the Victorian Cosmetic Institute & was talked into having 4mls of filler injected into my cheeks & nasolabial folds to lift my cheeks by self appointed \"cosmetic medicine specialist\" Dr Somaiye Kadivar. I was told that the filler was temporary & would last anywhere between 12-18 months.\\n\\nOnce the procedure was over I looked in the mirror & noticed one cheek was higher while the other cheek was lower & further out from my nose. My nasolabial folds were arched, crooked, unnatural & everytime I smiled my cheeks would pop out like golf balls. I hated the results because the filler added volume instead of a lift like I was led to believe.\\n\\nJust the thought of what I would have looked like if I had gone ahead with the 12 month \"alternative treatment plan” devised by the\\n\"cosmetic medicine specialist\" Dr Somaiye Kadivar who recommended 12mls of filler costing me over $9,000 and 60 units of Botox every 3 months for $720 per treatment gives me nightmares.\\n\\nSoon after I contacted the owner of the Victorian Cosmetic Institute Gavin Chan and complained about the botched filler. He assured me it was easily & instantly reversible by injecting Hyaluronidase which is used off label to dissolve fillers. After several attempts over the coming days & weeks it was quite obvious that the filler was still present.\\n\\nOn one occasion Gavin Chan dissolved my tear troughs via the cheeks yet I never had filler in my tear troughs to begin with. On another occasion while injecting Hyaluronidase he also started to inject filler into my temple without prior warning. When I asked him why he was injecting my temple he told me he was compensating me for my troubles yet never mentioned that the temple is a danger zone & a risky area to inject.\\n\\nIn total I had 6mls of filler injected into my face within 19 days, yet on the Victorian Cosmetic Institute\\'s website it states that 1ml of filler is enough for the entire face. On each occasion Gavin Chan never informed me of the risks, dangers & complications associated with Hyaluronidase & never gave me a consent form to read and sign.\\n\\nA few years later I had a consultation with Professor Mark Ashton who is an expert in filler complications & he told me that if the filler hadn\\'t dissolved by now then it was permanent. He gave me a referral for an MRI of the head which detects the exact amount of filler & the exact location of the filler. The MRI report stated that I still had upto 4mls of filler in my face even after all the dissolving sessions from many years ago.\\n\\nOn Dec 3rd 2018 I showed Gavin Chan my MRI results who had no idea at the time that MRI scans can detect fillers. His recommendation was more dissolving but in a larger dose so he flooded my face with Hyaluronidase yet never recorded the amount in my clinical notes.\\n\\nWhen I went back for a follow up consultation on Dec 10th 2018 he contacted radiologist Mobin Master in my presence who also appeared not to be aware at the time that MRI\\'s can detect filler but suggested I get another MRI anyway.\\n\\nNot long after, Gavin Chan contacted me via email thanking me for bringing the MRI information to his attention instead of thanking Professor Mark Ashton who he had previously corresponded with via email regarding my MRI results. For some unknown reason it did not occur to Gavin Chan that Professor Mark Ashton deserved all the credit for having known all along that MRI\\'s can detect dermal filler.\\n\\nInstead Gavin Chan chose to capitalise on this information by making a YouTube video claiming he had made this discovery after doing quite a few MRI\\'s (not sure how this is possible as he is not a radiologist). He also stated in his email that he wanted to inject a very high dose of Hyaluronidase to try and dissolve the filler again for the 5th time.\\n\\nIn the meantime I noticed that my facial structure had collapsed, I developed deep hollows under my eyes, my cheeks caved in, my marionette lines were deep, long & dragged down. The corners of my lips sunk into my mouth & my skin was extremely loose, saggy & stretchy all the way down to my neck.\\n\\nHyaluronidase did not dissolve my fillers but instead permanently dissolved my connective tissue as it can\\'t distinguish between the skin\\'s own HA & the HA in dermal fillers. Hyaluronidase has aged my facial features by 10 years & only a full facelift & necklift can fix this.\\n\\nIn 2019 & 2020 | took Gavin Chan to VCAT, a small claims court requesting a refund & a corrective advertising order because his website falsely advertised that the temporary fillers they use last anywhere between 12-18 months. Gavin Chan was granted lawyers on the grounds that his business reputation was at stake while I had to represent myself.\\n\\nI cross examined him with over 90 questions & I presented over 100 pages of supporting evidence & documentation while he only had photos & amended clinical notes. Mobin Master was also present in court supporting Gavin Chan. The hearing was held over 2 days & my claims were eventually dismissed by the judge.\\n\\nGavin Chan who \"specialises\" in cosmetic procedures got away with not providing a patch test for Hyaluronidase and not providing a consent form for Hyaluronidase on each occasion amongst other things.\\n\\nMobin Master who began posting the first MRI images on his\\nInstagram account 1 week after the first VCAT hearing in Nov 2019 now identifies as an \"aesthetic radiologist\" and a \"world pioneer\" in filler longevity.\\n\\nGavin Chan, the self appointed \"doctor trainer\" for various dermal fillers and anti-wrinkle injections and \"cosmetic surgeon\" as he once claimed to be isn\\'t even a GP, he is just a medical practitioner with no other formal training. His only qualification is a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery with a background in intensive care, anaesthesia and emergency medicine.\\n\\nGavin Chan who medically reviews his own articles has provided cosmetic procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections, dermal fillers, liposuction, facial fat transfers, skin needling and laser treatments since 2004 and has held advanced one-on-one injector training workshops for dermal fillers yet has no certificates or credentials listed on his Victorian Cosmetic Institute\\'s website.\\n\\nIn my opinion Gavin Chan has a special interest in portraying himself as the master of cosmetic injectables in an unregulated industry. He is an injectable junkie, obsessed with the syringe & makes no apologies for ruining my life. I hold Gavin Chan responsible for destroying my looks and my life.\\n\\nJust recently I was threatened on 2 occasions with legal action for posting Google reviews on Gavin Chan. His lawyers instructed me to remove each review within 7 days otherwise I would be sued for defamation in the Federal Court of Australia. I wasn\\'t even given a chance to respond to each email when my reviews were both taken down.\\n\\nI have no doubt in my mind that Gavin Chan was behind the removal of my reviews. Gavin Chan pays a lot of money to have my reviews removed as he doesn\\'t want anyone finding out the truth.\\n\\nIf you are a cosmetic injectable victim or want to be well informed regarding what can go wrong please join BOTCHED FILLERS & HYALURONIDASE DAMAGE SUPPORT GROUP on FB.', 'upvotes': 3518, 'num_comments': 402, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1als23e'}, {'subreddit': 'Asian_Beauty', 'title': 'Reminder to wear your sunscreen - Weird spot on turned out to be cancer', 'body': \"\\nI have a weird spot on my scalp, got it checked, and turns out it's white skin cancer (I'm 31 - we found it in an early stage so I will be fine.) \\n\\nBut please take this as a reminder to wear sunscreen daily on your face, chest, and hands (basically anything that's exposed) and to cover your head.\\n\\nThe doctor mentioned that he is seeing these kinds of cases more and more often in younger people.

The plastic surgeon Dr. Lara Devgan was renowned for her work with fillers. She uses Revanesse Versa which is an extremely dense, hydrophilic, long- lasting filler very similar to Voluma but cheaper. \\nThe filler looked good for 3-4 months and then I developed severe  facial edema and was eventually diagnosed with a delayed inflammatory/ hypersensitivity reaction to the filler.  I had not had COVID or any other viral illness. I’d had the vaccine six months before ever receiving filler. \\n\\nThe edema never went away. Dr. Devgan dropped me as a patient after lying to my face that filler couldn’t cause this. A CT scan, MRI, and multiple ultrasounds later proved that the filler had expanded and migrated literally all over my face. It was compromising my facial muscles and blocking my lymphatics— causing chronic swelling, poor skin quality, muscle weakness and chronic dry eye. \\n\\n I had to fly across the country to Seattle, WA, twice, to get it dissolved under ultrasound by a complications specialist. Well by then, it had been almost two years since the filler was injected. It had integrated into my tissue and I was informed that it would be impossible to remove all of it. Dissolving damaged my skin and caused systemic issues, reducing the swelling by only about 20%. \\n\\nI’m now left with semi permanent or permanent facial swelling and skin damage. \\n\\nFillers are a nightmare for some of us. For many people, it’s metabolized normally and effectively “goes away.”  For an ever increasing subset of patients, however,  it can trigger a serious autoimmune reaction  which is impossible to calm down if there is even a little piece still floating around. In these patients, the filler is not metabolized correctly and instead migrates , swells and expands. I’ve been told it will take 10-20 years or it will never go away.  The damage is likely irreversible. I’m only 29. \\n\\nDoctors aren’t there for you when you have complications from this procedure, because it’s really the bread and butter of their industry . Be prepared to be gaslit for years.
